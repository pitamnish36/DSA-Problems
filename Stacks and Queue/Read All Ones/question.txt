You are given a binary matrix, that is a matrix consisting of only 1s and 0s, of size m * n.

You have to find the rectangle of maximum area in this matrix consisting of all 1s, whose coordinates are of the form (0,a), (0,b), (c,a), (c,b) where a<=b and c>=0.

(0,0) is the bottom-left element of matrix, positive x axis is towards the right and positive y axis towards top.

Input Format

The first line of input contains 2 integers n and m, the dimensions of the matrix.

The next n lines of input consists of m binary integers (0 or 1), representing one row of the binary matrix.

Constraints

1 <= m,n <= 10^3

Output Format

Output contains a single integer, the area of the rectangle of maximum area that can be formed which consists of all 1s.
